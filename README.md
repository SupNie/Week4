# Week4
Reflections for Week 4(Web dev blog):
I learnt how to create responsive images by using flex-direction, flex-grow and padding to fix the size of the container in the items and learnt to create split UI.
Also, I learnt how to use GitHub, how to create a repository and cloning the repository to the visual studio code and creating a new html file inside it and finally being able to commit changes to it and push the html to create the new html inside the Github.
